# Note Taker

## Description
Keeping notes can be hard. So I built this handy note taker app! The app allows users to enter a note title and then add text. Once they are done creating their note they can click the save button at the top and the note will appear on the left side where they can view it again by clicking on it. The user can also create a new note by clicking the pencil icon in the top right. The information is stored on a server so it will be there even through a page reload!

This project was pretty tough. I learned a good amount about the get and post routes and how they view and change the database file. I attempted the delete route and got it mostly working but it will only work if you delete the first note and go down from there so it still needs some work. But that will be saved for the future.

This project is deployed at: https://powerful-garden-40928.herokuapp.com/
